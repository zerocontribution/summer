- Action Adventure 
  - Singleplayer
  - No graphics (just polygon shapes, colors representing different types of enemies)
    - Some enemies may be bigger, some slower / faster, some spawn as groups
    - Colors identify the type of monster
    - Orthogonal view
  - Monsters get up to 6-affixes (depending on level of monster)
    - Levels scale with players
    - +1 player level is 2 affixes
    - +3 player level is 5 affixes
    - etc
  - Affixes 
    - Affixes are seeded at level load: You will be more likely to get affix A than B
    - Each monster randomly selects affixes; no affix is incompatible with another
    - Examples:
      - EnrageTimerAffix
      - ExtraHealthAffix
      - FastAffix
      - HealerAffix
      - MissleSalvoAffix
      - ReflectDamageAffix
      - SapAffix
      - SentryAffix
    - Should aim for 20 affixes
  - Items can be found (not dropped off enemies)
    - Grants n buffs (regular 1, rare 2, epic 3)
    - Gives two different things
      - New abilities
      - Increased stats
    - Chance to get better items increases with progression into the map level
  - Abilities are found
  - Start with nothing
    - Each player can choose from an initial trait that defines the style of play
  - Traits
    - Strong: Slower, more powerful damage; more survivability-based
    - Quick: Faster, less powerful damage; 
  - Levels are 100% procedurally driven
    - Adventure-style: Each level is a room with chance for ability/item/enemy
    - Some rooms are trapped
  - Levels are saved to central server
    - Easier levels are dropped in rank; hearder levels ranked up
    - Players can choose what type of game they want to play
    - Players assigned ranks of levels - difficulty can change after death
    - All players get ranked in a ladder
  - A character can only live once (hardcore-ish)
    - Only one item can be saved after each death: This is how players build up their characters
      - Once an item is saved through death, you keep it forever (or until you trash it)
    - Death starts the player back at the beginning of a new level
